## Overview

This is a project that I wanted to complete using nothing but HTML and CSS. I started with a framework but wanted to solidify my CSS learning but doing vanilla CSS only. It has proven to be an excellent challenge. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
  
I built out the HTML semantic markup first, creating my classes, then moving into the CSS stylesheet where I worked each component completely before moving onto the next one. Some hiccups arose, as they do, but with the help of my mentor and code reviewer we were able to work past those. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I working on more CSS based projects as my goal is to ensure I have a firmer understaning in how child and psuedo elements work. 

### Useful resources

- [The mysterious 4px gap in between images](https://www.codeblocq.com/2016/09/The-mysterious-4px-gap-in-between-images/) - I ran into a mysterious gap between the main image and my container for the card. After researching together, Nikki found this article and it really helped me understand that the was due to the default display: inline block that occurs with images. To remove this, some changing of HTML classes was done and then putting the image in a display: block, resolved the issue. This is vital and something that I want to remember going forward.

## Acknowledgments

I want to acknowledege the help of my friend and mentor, Nikki Morely. She and I sat down over Google Meets and she helped me figure out this strange mystery gap in between the card and container elements that was really bothering me the most with this project. She wrote out some code to make for less code, and explained one of the important pieces I was missing, the display:block.
